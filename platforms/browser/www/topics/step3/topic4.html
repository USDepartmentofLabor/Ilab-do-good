<p><strong>Forced Labor and Trafficking in Persons</strong></p>
<p>All codes of conduct should include provisions prohibiting forced labor and trafficking in persons. Forced labor and trafficking are closely related and in some instances overlapping phenomena, and these issues are often combined into one category in a code of conduct.</p>

<p>A key resource for specific code of conduct provisions related to forced labor and trafficking is Verit&eacute;&rsquo;s (RST), funded by the U.S. Department of State. Launched in 2016, the RST comprises a set of compliance-oriented resources and tools for a range of entities including companies, federal contractors, federal procurement and contracting professionals, advocates, investors, consumers, and other stakeholders who work to address forced labor and human trafficking in supply chains. Tool 1, <a href="https://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.responsiblesourcingtool.org/codeofconduct&amp;exitTitle=www.responsiblesourcingtool.org&amp;fedpage=no">Sample Code of Conduct Provisions</a>, contains forced labor-related provisions that can be incorporated into a company or industry code of conduct. The RST also contains additional tools related to responsible labor recruitment, including Tool 3, <a href="https://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.responsiblesourcingtool.org/laborrecruitments&amp;exitTitle=www.responsiblesourcingtool.org&amp;fedpage=no">Criteria for Screening and Evaluating Labor Recruitment Candidates</a>, which assists companies in conducting due diligence in the screening and selection of labor recruiters to minimize the risk of human trafficking as a result of fraudulent or misleading recruitment practices.</p>

<p><strong>PROTECTIONS AGAINST TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS </strong></p>
<p><strong>Sample Code of Conduct Provisions </strong></p>
<p>A supply chain Code of Conduct establishes basic performance expectations for subcontractors, suppliers and agents. It is important that your company sourcing policy or Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits human trafficking and sets out protections for workers. The sample provisions below can be used by any company, including federal contractors and their subcontractors, as they consider how best to create, strengthen or revise their own supply chain policies.</p>
<p>The sample Code provision addresses factors that are &ldquo;enablers&rdquo; or contributors to situations or risks of human trafficking but is not intended to ensure compliance with specific legal requirements, such as Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Specific compliance requirements should be detailed in the terms and conditions of contracts with subcontractors, suppliers and agents.</p>
<p><strong>HUMAN TRAFFICKING</strong>: The ____________ Company strictly prohibits human trafficking in all of our operations and in those of all subcontractors, suppliers and agents in our global supply chain. Workers shall not be subject to any form of forced, compulsory, bonded, or indentured labor. All work must be voluntary and workers shall have the freedom to terminate their employment at any time without penalty, upon giving reasonable notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RECRUITMENT FEES AND TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES</strong>: Workers shall not be charged any fees or costs for recruitment, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, including costs associated with travel to the receiving country, and processing official job-related documents and work visas in both home and host countries. Workers shall be provided with return transportation to their country of origin, or compensation for the cost of return transportation, upon completion of their employment contract.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT</strong>: Written contracts of employment shall be provided to migrant workers in their native language, clearly indicating their rights and responsibilities and conditions of employment, including wages, benefits, working hours, locations of the work, living conditions, housing and associated costs, work-related hazards, and other working and employment conditions.</p>
<p>Migrant workers shall be provided with a copy of their employment contract at least five days prior to deployment in their native language. Workers with difficulty understanding the written contract shall be given a verbal explanation of the contract&rsquo;s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>The use of supplemental agreements and the practice of contract substitution or use of supplemental agreements by the employer to replace an original contract or any of its provisions with a new contract or terms that are less favorable to the worker is strictly prohibited. The required notice period for workers to terminate their contracts early shall not exceed one month, and once they have begun working, migrant workers shall not be penalized for early termination of their employment contract upon giving the required notice.</p>
<p>The notice period shall be waived in situations where the worker has suffered harassment or abuse, or is a victim of trafficking in persons. In such cases the employer shall also be responsible for paying the cost of return transportation for the affected worker.</p>
<p><strong>RETENTION OF PERSONAL DOCUMENTS</strong>: Confiscating, destroying, withholding or otherwise denying workers&rsquo; access to their identity or immigration documents, including work permits and travel documentation (e.g. passports), is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Workers must be provided with individual secure and lockable storage facilities for their identification documents and other valuables that are accessible to them at all times.</p>
<p><strong>DEPOSITS</strong>: Migrant workers shall not be required to lodge monetary deposits or security payments, or have a portion of their pay withheld at any time as a condition of obtaining or retaining employment.</p>
<p><strong>HUMANE TREATMENT</strong>: The workplace shall be free of any form of harsh or inhumane treatment. Disciplinary policies and procedures shall be clearly defined and communicated to all workers, and shall not include any inhumane disciplinary measures, including any corporal punishment, mental or physical coercion, or verbal abuse of workers. The use or threat of physical or sexual violence, harassment and intimidation against a worker, his or her family, or close associates, is strictly prohibited. Disciplinary procedures shall not include sanctions that result in wage deductions, reductions in benefits, or compulsory labor.</p>
<p><strong>WORKPLACE EQUALITY</strong>: All workers, irrespective of their nationality or legal status, shall be treated fairly and equally. Migrant workers shall benefit from conditions of work no less favorable than those available to country nationals (including but not limited to wages, benefits, and accommodations). Migrant workers (or their family members) shall not be threatened with denunciation to authorities to coerce them into taking up or maintaining employment.</p>
<p><strong>WAGES AND BENEFITS</strong>: All workers shall be paid at least the minimum wage required by applicable laws, and shall be provided all legally mandated benefits. Wage payments shall be made at regular intervals and directly to workers, in accordance with applicable law, if any, and shall not be delayed, deferred, or withheld.</p>
<p>Only deductions, advances, and loans authorized by national law are permitted and, if made or provided, shall only be taken with the full consent and understanding of workers. Information shall be provided to workers at the time of their hire about hours worked, rates of pay, and the calculation of legal deductions.</p>
<p>All workers must retain full and complete control over their earnings. Wage deductions must not be used to keep workers tied to the employer or to their jobs. Workers shall not be held in debt bondage or forced to work in order to pay off a debt. Deception in wage commitments, payment, advances, and loans is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>WORKING HOURS</strong>: Workers shall not be required to work in excess of the number of hours permitted by national law. Where the law is silent, normal working hours shall not exceed eight hours per day and 48 per week, and total working hours including overtime shall not exceed 60 hours.</p>
<p>All overtime shall be purely voluntary, unless part of a legally recognized collective bargaining agreement. No worker shall be made to work overtime under the threat of penalty, dismissal, or denunciation to authorities. No worker shall be made to work overtime as a disciplinary measure, or for failure to meet production quotas.</p>
<p><strong>FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND PERSONAL FREEDOM</strong>: Workers shall have unrestricted access to basic necessities such as clean drinking water and toilets during both work and non-work hours at the work site or in employer provided or arranged housing.</p>
<p>Workers&rsquo; freedom of movement shall not be unreasonably restricted. Workers shall not be physically confined to the workplace or related premises, such as employer- or recruiter-operated residences; nor shall any other coercive means be used to restrict workers&rsquo; freedom of movement or personal freedom.</p>
<p>Mandatory residence in employer-provided or arranged facilities shall not be made a condition of employment unless required by law.</p>
<p><strong>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</strong>: An effective, confidential grievance process shall be established to ensure that any worker, acting individually or with other workers, can submit a grievance without suffering any prejudice or retaliation of any kind. The grievance procedure shall include an appeals process for workers who disagree with how a grievance is resolved.</p>
<p>Grievance mechanisms shall be available in the worker&rsquo;s native language and include the ability to report grievances anonymously.</p>
<p><strong>PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES AND LABOR RECRUITERS</strong>: Companies should hire workers directly whenever possible. When the subcontracting of recruitment and hiring is necessary, companies shall ensure that the labor agencies they engage operate legally, are certified or licensed by the competent authority in their country of operation, do not charge recruitment fees, use only trained employees, and do not engage in fraudulent recruitment practices that place workers at risk for human trafficking and sexual exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>EMPLOYEE AWARENESS AND TRAINING</strong>: Workers must be made aware of their rights and responsibilities at the time of hire, including the terms and conditions of their employment contract, the provisions of this Code and all applicable laws and regulations of their home country, the country where the work is performed, and of any country and jurisdiction contracting the work.</p>
<p>Workers must be trained upon arrival in the receiving country on the company&rsquo;s workplace rules and procedures, the grievance process, the housing arrangements (if provided or arranged by the company), and the conditions of work, including any health and safety hazards and the precautions needed to ensure personal safety. Workers should be informed that the company prohibits the procurement of commercial sex.</p>

<p><strong>Addressing the Vulnerability of Migrants in Codes of Conduct</strong>Often, the workers who are most vulnerable to forced labor/trafficking are migrant and temporary workers, who make up a significant proportion of the workforce in certain industries and parts of the world. In some cases, employers obtain migrant and temporary labor through labor brokerage or recruitment services. Workers are highly vulnerable to a wide range of abuses in these situations. Some recruiters confiscate workers&rsquo; identity documents as a means to entrap them, and/or deceive workers about the nature of the work they will be doing, the working conditions, the housing and living arrangements, and other aspects of their employment. In some cases, workers are made to pay fees to recruiters, brokers and other actors along the migration chain&ndash;fees which may be impossible to pay back and lead to debt bondage. As enshrined in ILO Convention 181, all costs of recruiting labor should be borne by the employer&mdash;workers should never pay any cost to obtain a job.</p>
<p>If you know or suspect that there is migrant labor in your supply chain, it is important to include relevant standards and provisions in your code of conduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example in Action: Patagonia&rsquo;s Migrant Worker Standards</strong></p>
<p>When 2011 audits revealed indicators of forced labor, human trafficking, and labor exploitation in Patagonia&rsquo;s supplier factories in Taiwan, the outdoor apparel company realized that despite its existing Supplier Workplace Code of Conduct, more robust standards were needed. Patagonia collaborated with Verit<a href="http://www.verite.org/">&eacute;</a>, an NGO that promotes safe, fair, and legal working conditions worldwide, to conduct research to better understand the situation of migrant workers in their supply chain. Upon finding that many migrants fall victims to an exploitative labor recruitment system that leaves workers laden with excessive broker fees and vulnerable to debt bondage, Patagonia developed comprehensive migrant worker standards. These standards ban supplier factories from charging recruitment fees and cover a range of other issues relevant for migrant workers, including living and working conditions, wages, and greivance procedures. Patagonia&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.patagonia.com/static/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-PatagoniaShared/default/dw604fc14d/PDF-US/Migrant_Worker_Employment_Standards.pdf&amp;exitTitle=www.patagonia.com&amp;fedpage=no">Migrant Worker Employment Standards</a> are publicly available.</p>

<p>. An important policy document focused on vulnerable migrant workers is the<a href="http://www.dhaka-principles.org/pdf/2012-12-18-Dhaka-Principles-Long-Version-English.pdf"> Dhaka Principles for Migration with Dignity</a> (Dhaka Principles). The Dhaka Principles consist of ten principles that trace the worker from recruitment, through employment, to the end of the employment relationship, and provide key principles that employers and migrant recruiters should respect to ensure migration with dignity. The Dhaka Principles were developed by the Institute for Human Rights and Business (IHRB) and are supported by businesses, governments, trade unions, and civil society. They are based on international human rights standards and the three pillars of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.</p>
<p><strong>Example in Action</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment</strong></p>
<p>Launched in May 2016, the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment is a collaboration between leading companies and expert organizations to drive positive change in the way that migrant workers are recruited. Members of the Leadership Group have committed to the&nbsp;Employer Pays Principle: <em>"No worker should pay for a job &ndash; the costs of recruitment should be borne not by the worker but by the employer." </em></p>
<p>Convened by the Institute for Human Rights and Business (IHRB), the Leadership Group calls for the Employer Pays Principle to be embedded in corporate and government policy and practice to protect migrant workers and counter the risk of forced labor in their own operations, business relationships, and global supply chains. Together, the Leadership Group provides a vehicle for advocacy and collaboration and serves as a knowledge hub for sharing good practices, tools, and guidance in relation to responsible recruitment.</p>

<p>In some cases, migrant workers are provided accommodations by their employers as part of the terms of employment. For employers, this is a means to recruit and keep valuable employees, and for migrant workers who have traveled far from home, this arrangement can provide needed housing. However, such housing must be safe, clean and appropriate to the worker population. Workers must always have freedom of movement, and the right to choose other housing if they wish. According to the ILO, if workers are living in &ldquo;degrading living conditions&rdquo; in employer-provided housing, and are also subject to some form of penalty or threat preventing them from leaving their jobs, this would amount to a forced labor situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The content of the RST was provided by Verit&eacute;, a labor rights organization with expertise in supply chain compliance. The development of the RST was supported by the U.S. Department of State&rsquo;s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons and included input from other partners in the U.S. government, including the U.S. Department of Labor.&rdquo;</p>
