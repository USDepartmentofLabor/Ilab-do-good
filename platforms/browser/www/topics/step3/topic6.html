<p><strong>Joining an</strong> <strong>Existing Code</strong></p>
<p>In certain industries, groups of companies have already come together to develop joint social compliance systems that individual companies can adopt by joining the group. In most cases these groups either have a code of conduct or are in the process of developing one together.</p>
<p>There are both advantages and disadvantages associated with industry codes. On the positive side, they capitalize on the experiences and ideas of multiple companies and pool resources to minimize overall effort and time spent on code development. In addition, in industries such as apparel where many brands tend to share suppliers, a single agreed-upon code ensures that individual suppliers do not undergo numerous audits under diverging codes and can focus on improving compliance with a clear set of standards.</p>
<p>On the negative side, in the course of code development any member company may have to make compromises on certain provisions. As a company, it is important to understand your supply chain and its risks and challenges before making a decision about joining a group code, in order to ensure that the group code makes strong policy commitments in the areas that are most important and salient to your business.</p>
<p>Examples of industry codes include <a href="http://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://bettercotton.org/&amp;exitTitle=bettercotton.org&amp;fedpage=no">the Better Cotton Initiative&rsquo;s Production Principles and Criteria</a> for companies throughout the cotton supply chain, the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.eicc.info/&amp;exitTitle=www.eicc.info&amp;fedpage=no">Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition Code</a> for electronics companies, the Bonsucro Production Standard for companies in the sugarcane supply chain,&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.ethicaltrade.org/eti-base-code/&amp;exitTitle=www.ethicaltrade.org&amp;fedpage=no">Ethical Trading Initiative&rsquo;s Base Code for companies in a variety of industries.</a></p>
<p>There are also industry groups that do not require member adherence to a specific code, but that have developed general policy statements and statements of commitment for members to adopt. Examples include the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.aiag.org/ScriptContent/index.cfm/&amp;exitTitle=www.aiag.org&amp;fedpage=no">Automotive Industry Action Group</a> and the Consumer Goods Forum&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/strategic-focus/social-sustainability/forced-labour-priority-industry-principles">Priority Industry Principles</a> on forced labor.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are multi-stakeholder groups that have developed guidance for a particular product or line of products. Examples include: 1) <a href="http://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.oecd.org/document/36/0,3746,en_2649_34889_44307940_1_1_1_1,00.html&amp;exitTitle=www.oecd.org&amp;fedpage=no">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas Supplement on Tin, Tantalum and Tungsten</a>; 2) <a href="http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/responsible-supply-chains-textile-garment-sector.htm">OECD Due Diligence For Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector</a>; 3) <a href="http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/rbc-agriculture-supply-chains.htm">OECD Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains</a>; 4) <a href="http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/Practical-actions-for-worst-forms-of-child-labour-mining-sector.pdf">OECD Practical Actions for Companies to Identify and Address the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Mineral Supply Chains</a>.</p>
<p>It is both increasingly common and beneficial for companies to require that their subcontractors and suppliers adhere to their code of conduct or a relevant industry code. Verit&eacute;&rsquo;s Responsible Sourcing Tool contains a <a href="http://www.responsiblesourcingtool.org/vendoragreement">Sample Social Responsibility Agreement</a> to supplement contracts and agreements between a company and its subcontractors or suppliers in the area of code flowdown and compliance, including in areas of self-assessment and improvement programs designed to achieve code compliance.</p>
