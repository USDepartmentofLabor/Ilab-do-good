<p><strong>Essential Components of a Company Grievance Mechanism Narrative Description</strong></p>
<img src="topics/step4/images/essential_components.jpg" alt="This graphic depicts the basic steps and elements of a grievance mechanism.  It begins with an outline of project impacts and shows how they, when applied to a grievance mechanism, can lead to the outcomes of reduced risk; enhanced reputation; better community relations; improved business processes and operations; adherence to international norms and standards; and avoidance of litigation.  Project impacts include stakeholder identification and analysis (including gender issues); S&E impact assessment; stakeholder consultation; and information disclosure.  The graphic shows how these impacts can be applied to the five basic steps and five underlying principles of a grievance mechanism.  The basic steps include: publicize the mechanism; receive and register; review and evaluate; respond to grievances; and monitor and evaluate.  The five principles include: 1) proportionality: scaled to risk and adverse impact on affected communities; 2. cultural appropriateness: designed taking into account culturally acceptable ways of handling community concerns; 3. accessibility: clear and understandable mechanism that is accessible to all segments of the affected communities at no cost; 4. transparency and accountability relative to all stakeholders; and 5. appropriate protection: a mechanism that excludes retribution and does not impede access to judicial or administrative remedies.  The graphic illustrates how all of these factors lead to a sixth step, revising the management system, which, in turn, results in positive outcomes."/>
