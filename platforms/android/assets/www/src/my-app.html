What services should you provide to a victim  of labor trafficking,  if one is identified in your supply chain?   Who should you hire to provide training to your key suppliers on social  compliance? </p> <p>Do not try  to answer these questions by yourself.   By involving your stakeholders in your system, you will gather more  ideas and have a broader range of people with whom to vet issues and  solutions.  Stakeholder involvement  allows you to gather a variety of perspectives before you commit to a  particular approach.  Engaging stakeholders  can help you to understand the consequences of certain decisions and actions  for specific stakeholders, the varied and changing expectations from  stakeholders, and the key issues that surface in your supply chains.  It also provides buy-in, because those who  participate in the development of a system will be less likely to criticize it  later if they see their ideas integrated into your selected approach and  programs.</p>',

Engaging stakeholders  can help you to understand the consequences of certain decisions and actions  for specific stakeholders, the varied and changing expectations from  stakeholders, and the key issues that surface in your supply chains.  It also provides buy-in, because those who  participate in the development of a system will be less likely to criticize it  later if they see their ideas integrated into your selected approach and  programs.</p>',
