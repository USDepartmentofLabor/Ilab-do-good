Many companies refer to their codes by a name other than “code of conduct,” but the term is used throughout this toolkit for consistency and clarity. A code is a set of voluntary standards; in this respect it differs from law—although relevant laws (both U.S. and source country) must be taken into account, as should collective bargaining agreements and international framework agreements (IFAs) with union federations, which are enforceable contracts.  A code is not a substitute for any of these instruments. Prior to the mid-1990s, few companies had codes of conduct that included labor standards.  The late 1990s saw a proliferation of codes, particularly in the apparel sector, and this trend spread into other sectors over the decade that followed."
