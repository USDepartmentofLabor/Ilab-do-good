<p><strong>Where, When and How Should Training be Conducted? </strong></p>
<p>Some social compliance teams have in-house staff members who develop training materials for their company&rsquo;s program. Others contract out this function, or use training materials developed by an industry or cross-industry group. In some cases, it is also feasible and fruitful to engage some stakeholder groups in training other stakeholder groups. For example, vendors or agents can be trained, and then be charged with training all the managers, supervisors and human resources staff of the production facilities from which they source. Trade unions can also play an important role in developing training materials and raising awareness among workers and/or communities on social compliance issues.</p>

<p>Training for workers should be designed according to the particular worker population. In a country or geographic area where most workers have at least a basic education, training may also be taught in a classroom setting using written materials. However, there are industries and geographic areas where a significant proportion of workers may be illiterate or simply have very little experience in a classroom. In such cases, training methods and materials must be adapted to ensure that workers still capture the necessary information. Specific training formats have been developed for such populations, including films, graphical materials, posters and other visuals.</p>
<p>In areas where many workers may lack basic education, some companies choose to go beyond basic social compliance training to offer literacy and numeracy education at the worksite or scholarships for such education. These efforts are often tied to the company&rsquo;s overall philanthropy portfolio, discussed further in <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/child-forced-labor/Addressing-Root-Causes.htm"><em>Addressing Root Causes</em></a>.</p>
<p>Cultural norms are also a key consideration in designing trainings. For instance, in some countries, men and women must be seated separately or separated by a certain distance within a room. In some cases, a trainer of a certain gender may be more appropriate for a particular group. Issues like eye contact and personal space are important for trainers to understand. It is also critical to have an understanding of teaching styles that are common in the area &ndash; for instance, in many cultures, raising one&rsquo;s hand to answer a question or having a group &ldquo;brainstorm&rdquo; is unheard of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some companies also choose to tie their social compliance training to other forms of training they may offer. In fact, many companies have found that integrating social compliance training into trainings on other topics like productivity, quality assurance and industry-specific technical skills has many benefits. Workers with improved skills are likely to be valued more highly and treated better, and improved workforce technical skills and productivity have concrete impacts on producers and suppliers&rsquo; incomes, so the trainings may be deemed more important by management and supervisors.</p>
<p>The ILO&rsquo;s Program for <a href="https://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.ilo.org/empent/Projects/score/lang--en/index.htm&amp;exitTitle=www.ilo.org&amp;fedpage=no">Sustaining Competitive and Responsible Enterprises (SCORE)</a> a training program to increase the productivity of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) while promoting recognition of and respect for the ILO&rsquo;s international labor standards and improving working conditions. SCORE provides &ldquo;training of trainers&rdquo; for government agencies, industry associations and trade unions, and other organizations, who then deliver the training program to SMEs. SCORE is currently active in emerging economies throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and as of April 2017, over 1,000 SMEs representing over 270,000 workers, have participated in SCORE trainings..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developing materials, scheduling training sessions, hiring trainers and tracking training delivery are all significant investments. There are various ways to structure financing for your training program. Some companies simply choose to allocate a large portion of their social compliance budget to training and capacity building, believing that training helps to prevent problems and ultimately saves money. Some companies provide a core set of trainings free of charge, but if code violations are found for which training is required as part of remediation, the supplier then pays those training costs. In some relationships, the vendors/agents or suppliers handle all responsibilities related to training, including all costs.</p>
<p>Grievance mechanisms are the cornerstone of collective bargaining. They allow workers to raise issues with employers without fear of reprisal. However, workers without the protection of a collective bargaining agreement should also have ways to make anonymous complaints and should have whistleblower protections.</p>
<p>Your company should ensure that safe, accessible channels are available to workers to lodge complaints about any issue related to your code of conduct. Ideally, multiple channels should be available, such as through trade unions (if available), through supervisors or supplier management, or directly to your company or a third-party that you engage for this purpose. Procedures for bringing a grievance to each available channel should be clearly explained at training sessions and posted at the worksite, in all applicable languages. When auditors and/or independent verification organizations visit worksites, workers should be encouraged to make known any complaints to them in a confidential setting.</p>
<p>Standard procedures should also be in place for handling and resolving complaints that are received through all channels. These procedures should be clearly explained and posted. The procedures should include protection of privacy and protection from reprisal for the person or group bringing the complaint, as well as a communications protocol to notify both the complainant and other affected stakeholders of the outcome of the grievance.</p>
<p>Technology is playing an increasing role in the ability of companies, labor unions, civil society organizations, and third-party monitoring groups to capture workers&rsquo; grievances and address worker rights. With more than 7 billion mobile subscriptions globally, many initiatives, such as <a href="https://www.laborvoices.com/">Labor Voices</a>, rely on smart phone technology to administer anonymous surveys that poll workers on their working conditions in factories and fields. Other initiatives, such as <a href="http://www.contratados.org/">Contratados.org</a>, utilize web-based technology to create online platforms by which workers, including labor migrants, are able to rate and comment on labor recruiters and contractors in their native languages. Technologies that capture &ldquo;worker voice&rdquo; are often cost effective, targeted, and safe for workers. They can provide a valuable supplement to traditional social audits, as well as provide effective mechanisms for educating workers on their rights and available resources.</p>
<p><strong>In Their Own Words</strong></p>
<p><strong>Establishing Effective Grievance Mechanisms</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Operation-level grievance mechanisms for those potentially impacted by enterprises&rsquo; activities can be an effective means &hellip; when they meet the core criteria of: legitimacy, accessibility, predictability, equitability&hellip; and transparency, and are based on dialogue and engagement with a view to seeking agreed solutions. Such mechanisms can be administered by an enterprise alone or in collaboration with other stakeholders and can be a source of continuous learning. Operational-level grievance mechanisms should not be used to undermine the role of trade unions in addressing labor-related disputes, nor should such mechanisms preclude access to judicial or non-judicial grievance mechanisms.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>In 2009-2010, the Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative (CSRI) at the Harvard Kennedy School examined pilot projects commissioned by the UN Special Representative on Business and Human Rights. These pilots were focused on testing grievance mechanisms involving business enterprises and communities in which they operate. The <a href="https://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/publications/report_46_GM_pilots.pdf&amp;exitTitle=www.unglobalcompact.org&amp;fedpage=no">CSRI project</a> resulted in a revised set of principles for effective grievance mechanisms:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Legitimacy: </strong>Enabling trust from the stakeholder groups for whose use they are intended, and being accountable for the fair conduct of grievance processes;</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility: </strong>Being known to all stakeholder groups for whose use they are intended, and providing adequate assistance for those who may face particular barriers to access;</li>
    <li><strong>Predictability: </strong>Providing a clear and known procedure with an indicative time frame for each state, and clarity on the types of process and outcome available and means of monitoring implementation;</li>
    <li><strong>Equitability: </strong>Seeking to ensure that aggrieved parties have reasonable access to sources of information, advice and expertise necessary to engage in a grievance process on fair, informed and respectful terms;</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency: </strong>Keeping parties to a grievance informed about its progress, and providing sufficient information about the mechanism&rsquo;s performance to build confidence in its effectiveness and meet any public interest at stake;</li>
    <li><strong>Rights-compatibility: </strong>Ensuring that outcomes and remedies accord with internationally recognized human rights;</li>
    <li><strong>Dialogue and engagement: </strong>Consulting the stakeholder groups for whose use they are intended on their design and performance, and focusing on dialogue as the means to address and resolve grievances;</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous learning: </strong>Drawing on relevant measures to identify lessons for improving the mechanism and preventing future grievances and harms.</li>
