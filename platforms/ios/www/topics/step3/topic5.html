<p><strong>How to Develop a Code</strong></p>
<p>The scope and coverage of your code should match the scope and coverage of the compliance system overall. If your company chooses to develop its own code instead of joining an existing one, it is important to first familiarize yourself with good practices in code development. For instance, the process should be transparent and allow for input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including workers and their representatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ISEAL Alliance, a global association for social and environmental standards, has published a <a href="http://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.isealalliance.org/our-work/codes-of-good-practice/standard-setting-code/&amp;exitTitle=www.isealalliance.org&amp;fedpage=no">Code of Good Practice for Standard-Setting</a> that outlines the fundamental steps in developing any set of standards. According to ISEAL the process should include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clearly defining the objectives of the standard and justifying its need</li>
    <li>Identifying affected stakeholders and providing them opportunities to participate</li>
    <li>Having public consultations and ensuring a balance of interests</li>
    <li>Making the standard publicly available and reviewing it on a regular basis</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these principles is more fully elaborated in the ISEAL Code of Good Practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example in Action</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fair Labor Association Code Revision Process</strong></p>
<p>The Fair Labor Association (FLA) is a nonprofit organization that monitors conditions in affiliated factories for compliance with its Workplace Code of Conduct, based on ILO standards, and also has detailed provisions for remediation when violations are identified. The code is supplemented by FLA Compliance Benchmarks, which identify specific standards for each code element. In June 2011 the FLA Board of Directors approved significant enhancements to the Workplace Code of Conduct and Compliance Benchmarks. Six out of nine elements of the adopted code were either newly created or revised, in areas ranging from employment relations, hours of work and compensation to health, safety and environment. The revised code was developed over a two-year period through a process that sought suggestions from a broad range of stakeholders and was adopted by a board that includes equal representation from companies, NGOs and university members.&nbsp;</p>
