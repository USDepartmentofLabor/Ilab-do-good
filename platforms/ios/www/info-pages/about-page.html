    In the era of globalization, the production of goods in foreign countries has increased at a rapid pace. Unfortunately in too many countries, illegal labor practices persist, either going unchecked or willfully ignored. Lack of accountability and oversight of labor rights has made it more likely that goods imported into the U.S. may be tainted by child labor and forced labor. This is a violation of U.S. trade policy that gives an unfair competitive advantage to countries and businesses that do not play by the rules. In turn, such abuses force U.S. workers and responsible businesses to compete on an uneven playing field.
</p>
<p>
    The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 168 million children in child labor worldwide, 85 million of them in hazardous forms of work. It also estimates that 21 million people are in forced labor, six million of them children.
</p>
<p>
    By downloading this toolkit, you have shown that your company is concerned about these grim realities. You are interested in reducing the chance that your products&#8212;and the raw materials they come from&#8212;are manufactured, mined or harvested by children who should be in school, or by workers locked in sweatshops or forced into work through false promises or threats.
</p>
<p>
    This toolkit was created by the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB). ILAB promotes a fair global playing field for workers in the United States and around the world by enforcing trade commitments; strengthening labor standards; and combating international child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking.

        Why did the Department of Labor develop this toolkit?
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2005 mandate that ILAB &#8220;work with persons who are involved in the production of goods on [ILAB&#8217;s
    <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ILAB/programs/ocft/tvpra.htm">
        <em>List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</em>
    </a>
    ] to create a standard set of practices that will reduce the likelihood that such persons will produce goods using [forced and child labor].&#8221;
</p>
<p>
    This toolkit responds to this mandate, but it also achieves a much broader purpose by actively supporting the efforts of companies that seek to address these issues within their own supply chains. The toolkit also responds to efforts being made by the international community. In September 2015, UN member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of seventeen inter-related, mutually reinforcing goals for global development over the next 15 years. Within each of the SDGs, specific targets have been set which will be essential to achieving the goals. Under SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth, Target 8.7 calls on governments to:
</p>
<p>
    &#8220;Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labor, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labor, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labor in all its forms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
    ILAB is actively engaged in Alliance 8.7, a global partnership that aims to provide strategic coordination of diverse stakeholders with an interest in achieving Target 8.7. A key actor in this alliance is the business community. Eradicating child and forced labor by 2025 cannot be achieved without sustained commitment from the businesses that mine, produce, manufacture, distribute, and sell goods around the world. Businesses create jobs and find workers to perform the jobs; they bear a responsibility to ensure that these working relationships respect national laws and fundamental labor rights. Some businesses and industry groups have long taken this responsibility seriously, through robust voluntary standards, due diligence, remediation, transparency, and engagement with stakeholders. Now, the combination of increased pressure from stakeholders and incentives to develop stronger responses is driving more businesses to acknowledge and address labor abuses in their supply chains. ILAB is committed to working alongside the business community in this effort.
</p>
<p>
    Since 1993, ILAB has developed a unique approach to using research to combat these abuses. ILAB employs a systematic and rigorous process to triangulate information, supporting the collection of in-country data, traveling to conduct first hand research in hard-to-reach places, and corroborating reports of labor abuses with credible local sources. This approach helps ensure the credibility and validity of ILAB&#8217;s publications on child labor and forced labor. ILAB uses these reports to provide critical and actionable information to federal government agencies to safeguard federal procurement, help U.S. companies reduce labor abuses in their supply chains, and help foreign governments build their capacity to end modern slavery in their countries. This toolkit is part of that effort.
</p>
<p>
    The toolkit is also an important component of the U.S. government&#8217;s
    <a href="https://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/265918.pdf&amp;exitTitle=www.state.gov&amp;fedpage=no">
        National Action Plan on Responsible Business Conduct
    </a> (NAP-RBC), which was developed pursuant to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development&#8217;s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The NAP-RBC encompasses the U.S. government&#8217;s efforts and commitments to protect human rights in the overseas operations of U.S. businesses, through research, technical cooperation, federal procurement practices, labor diplomacy, and public-private dialogue. The NAP-RBC also emphasizes the positive contributions that businesses can make to respect human rights.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, since 1995, the U.S. Congress has also appropriated funding to ILAB for programming to combat child labor internationally through
    <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/icltc.htm">
        technical assistance projects
    </a> . ILAB has used these funds to implement more than 300 in over 95 countries, in partnership with a variety of governments, international institutions, civil society organizations and industry groups.

            Many organizations contributed to the development of this toolkit, including the National Academy of Science and the Center for Reflection, Education and Action (CREA), under contract with ILAB; and the organizations whose materials are linked throughout the toolkit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first online edition of the Toolkit was published in December 2012. In 2017, ILAB adapted it for a mobile application, released in September 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
            In developing the toolkit, ILAB sought feedback from interagency partners across the U.S. Government, as well as a focus group of external experts from business, academia, unions, the socially responsible investment community and other civil society groups. ILAB greatly appreciates the contributions of all who participated in this process.

            This toolkit is primarily designed for companies that have not yet put social compliance systems in place and are seeking assistance with doing so voluntarily. It can also be useful for companies that have systems in place but are seeking improvement, or those who are working with partners in their global supply chains to establish such programs.

            The toolkit is organized around <strong> eight steps to building or improving a social compliance system </strong> . Each step begins with learning objectives and key terms. Companies that are new to social compliance are encouraged to work through the modules in order. Companies that wish to improve elements of their systems or work with their supply chain partners can choose which modules best fit their needs. However, they are encouraged to consider implementing all elements of the social compliance system presented here in order to ensure integration of all components of their systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            As companies familiar with social compliance know, this toolkit is just one of many guides, handbooks, white papers and other materials that provide information on social compliance. We hope this toolkit provides useful guidance and examples available to help you build or strengthen your social compliance system or that of your global supply chain partners.

            Because ILAB&#8217;s TVPRA mandate is to work with persons who are involved in the production of goods, this toolkit focuses on social compliance programs for companies that produce goods, rather than services. In addition, as noted above, it focuses in particular on issues related to child labor and forced labor.
