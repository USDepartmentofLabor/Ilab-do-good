<p><strong>Industry Associations and Initiatives</strong></p>
<p>Another way to identify and engage stakeholders and partners is through industry-led platforms, industry associations and industry-specific initiatives. Examples are below.</p>

<p><strong>Eliminating Child Labor in Tobacco-Growing (ECLT) Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Launched in 2002, the ECLT Foundation employs a multi-stakeholder approach in preventing child labor in tobacco production and in protecting and improving the lives of children in tobacco growing areas. The ECLT Foundation&rsquo;s efforts follow a tripartite model that includes governments, trade unions, and employers, as well as civil society organizations, public sector representatives, and other stakeholders that address child labor in tobacco growing. As a member of the UN Global Compact and the ILO&rsquo;s Child Labor Platform, the ECLT Foundation engages in global advocacy on child labor, as well as serves as a hub for research and improving the knowledge base on child labor. Since 2003, the ECLT Foundation has conducted projects with a range of public and private stakeholders in countries where child labor in the production of tobacco is prevalent, including in <a href="http://www.eclt.org/project-countries/guatemala/">Guatemala</a>, <a href="http://www.eclt.org/project-countries/kyrgyzstan/">Kyrgyzstan</a>, <a href="http://www.eclt.org/project-countries/malawi/">Malawi</a>, <a href="http://www.eclt.org/project-countries/mozambique/">Mozambique</a>, <a href="http://www.eclt.org/project-countries/philippines/">Philippines</a>, <a href="http://www.eclt.org/project-countries/tanzania/">Tanzania</a>, <a href="http://www.eclt.org/project-countries/uganda/">Uganda</a>, and <a href="http://www.eclt.org/project-countries/zambia/">Zambia</a>. These projects have five strategic objectives: withdrawing children from child labor, providing education, raising awareness, strengthening communities, and alleviating poverty. In 2015, the ECLT entered into a 3-year public-private partnership&nbsp;with the ILO to develop global guidance on the hazards of child labor in tobacco growing.</p>

<p><strong>Child Labor Platform</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Child Labor Platform (CLP) is a business-led forum that aims to tackle child labor in supply chains. The CLP works to identify the obstacles to the implementation of the ILO Conventions on child labor in supply chains and surrounding communities, identify practical ways of overcoming these obstacles, and catalyse collective action. This means carrying out due diligence to identify, prevent, mitigate, remediate, and account for any adverse effects on children&rsquo;s right to be free from child labour that businesses cause, contribute to, or are linked with through their relationships and operations. Since 2012, the CLP has operated as part of the UN Global Compact&rsquo;s Human Rights and Labor Working Group, with the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) serving as co-chairs. In 2015, members of the CLP, including companies from the food and beverage, apparel, and mining sectors contributed to the production of a <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/download.do?type=document&amp;id=27555">Child Labor Guidance Tool for Business</a>, which was authored by the ILO and the IOE, and which serves as a resource for companies to meet the due diligence requirements laid out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as they pertain to child labor. New businesses and relevant organizations are welcomed onto the CLP on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p><strong>ILO&rsquo;s Global Business Network on Forced Labor and Human Trafficking:</strong></p>
<p>The ILO&rsquo;s Global Business Network on Forced Labor and Human Trafficking, funded by DOL and set to launch in 2018, will bring together employers&rsquo; organizations, businesses, and other stakeholders to provide opportunities to share information on how companies from a range of sectors conduct due diligence and risk assessments related to forced labor and human trafficking in their business operations. The Global Business Network will provide opportunities for companies to benchmark their performance and to facilitate peer learning on forced labor issues, including through the exchange of information on self-regulatory initiatives and best practices on managing complex supply chains. The Global Business Network will work in collaboration with the Child Labor Platform to ensure the full support and involvement of the business community towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals under ILO Alliance 8.7 &ndash; a global partnership aimed at ending child labor, forced labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Certification Programs</strong></p>
<p>Another option for developing social compliance programs is to explore existing <strong>certification </strong>programs. These programs certify products or processes against established sets of standards; some of them confer a label on certified products in order to directly reach consumers and communicate that the product was produced under certain conditions.</p>
<p>While there are few existing certification programs that confer a &ldquo;child labor free&rdquo; or &ldquo;forced labor free&rdquo; label, there are programs that include child labor, forced labor and other labor issues in their certification standards. For example, the Fair Trade program is primarily aimed at ensuring a &ldquo;fair&rdquo; price for producers at the bottom of the supply chain, but producers must also meet child labor, forced labor and other labor standards in order to earn the &ldquo;Fair Trade&rdquo; certification. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.fairtrade.net/child-labour.html">Fairtrade International</a> and <a href="http://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/&amp;exitTitle=www.fairtradeusa.org&amp;fedpage=no">Fair Trade USA</a> toolkits.</p>
<p>Some certification programs aim to meet the standards of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.isealalliance.org/&amp;exitTitle=www.isealalliance.org&amp;fedpage=no">ISEAL Alliance</a>, an association of organizations with that develops guidance on establishment and implementation of sustainability-related standards.</p>
<p>At the same time, some certification programs&mdash;and multi-stakeholder initiatives more broadly&mdash;have come under criticism related to governance arrangements, such as certification programs&rsquo; financing structures, balance of power among members and mechanisms for holding members accountable. Other criticism is related to implementation, such as issues around inadequate or insufficient auditing and inadequate stakeholder outreach. It is therefore important to understand the structure of particular programs in order to assess how they will be viewed by different stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example in Action</strong></p>
<p>For over 20 years, GoodWeave has been working to transform the carpet industry by encouraging market demand for child-labor free rugs and helping businesses to meet that demand. Rug importers and exporters that wish to be licensed by GoodWeave and earn a consumer-facing GoodWeave label must sign a legally binding contract to abide by GoodWeave&rsquo;s rigorous standard for certifying that rugs are free from child labor, forced labor, and bonded labor. As part of the certification program, companies agree to permit unannounced inspections in their supply chains to monitor for compliance with the standard and ensure that violations are remediated. Companies also pay licensing fees that support GoodWeave&rsquo;s programs for monitoring and inspection of workplaces and the rehabilitation and education of exploited children. GoodWeave is a full member of the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling (ISEAL) Alliance, an association widely known as a world leader in establishing best practices for certification standards. In the past few years, GoodWeave has expanded the reach of its program beyond the carpet industry in India, to new sectors and countries, including the brick kilns of Nepal, apparel factories in India, and home-based carpet production in Afghanistan (the latter through a DOL-funded project).
