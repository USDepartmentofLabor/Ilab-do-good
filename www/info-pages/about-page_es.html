<h1>Acerca de la aplicación Comply Chain</h1>
<p>En la era de la globalización, la producción de bienes en países extranjeros se ha incrementado a un ritmo rápido. Desafortunadamente en muchos países, las prácticas laborales ilegales persisten, ya sea que no se controle o se ignore intencionalmente. La falta de rendición de cuentas y la supervisión de los derechos laborales ha hecho que sea más probable que los bienes importados en los Estados Unidos estén contaminados por el trabajo infantil y el trabajo forzoso. La importación de bienes fabricados con mano de obra forzada es una violación de la política comercial de EE. UU. Que otorga una ventaja competitiva injusta a países y empresas que no cumplen con las reglas. A su vez, estos abusos obligan a los trabajadores estadounidenses y a las empresas responsables a competir en un campo de juego desigual.</p>
<p>La Organización Internacional del Trabajo (OIT) estima que hay 152 millones de niños de entre 5 y 17 años en el trabajo infantil en todo el mundo, 73 millones de ellos en formas peligrosas de trabajo. También estima que 25 millones de adultos y niños se encuentran en trabajos forzados.</p>
<p>By downloading this App, you have shown that you are concerned about these grim realities. You are interested in reducing the chance that your products&mdash;and the raw materials they come from&mdash;are manufactured, mined or harvested by children who should be in school, or by workers locked in sweatshops or forced into work through false promises or threats.</p>
<p>This App was created by the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB). ILAB promotes a fair global playing field for workers in the United States and around the world by enforcing trade commitments; strengthening labor standards; and combating international child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2 slot="label"><strong>¿Por qué el Departamento de Trabajo desarrolló esta aplicación?</strong></h2>
    <div slot="items">
        <p>The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2005 mandate that ILAB &ldquo;work with persons who are involved in the production of goods on [ILAB&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/" title="List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor"><em>List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</em></a>] to create a standard set of practices that will reduce the likelihood that such persons will produce goods using [forced and child labor].&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This App responds to this mandate, but it also achieves a much broader purpose by actively supporting the efforts of companies that seek to address these issues within their own supply chains. In addition, the App responds to efforts being made by the international community. In September 2015, UN member states adopted the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300" title="Sustainable Development Goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs), a set of seventeen inter-related, mutually reinforcing goals for global development over the next 15 years. Within each of the SDGs, specific targets have been set which will be essential to achieving the goals. Under <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg8" title="SDG 8">SDG 8</a> on Decent Work and Economic Growth, Target 8.7 calls on governments to:</p>
        <p class="indent-margin">&ldquo;Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labor, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labor, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labor in all its forms.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>ILAB is actively engaged in <a href="http://www.alliance87.org/" title="Alliance 8.7">Alliance 8.7</a>, a global partnership that aims to provide strategic coordination of diverse stakeholders with an interest in achieving Target 8.7. A key actor in this alliance is the business community. Eradicating child and forced labor by 2025 cannot be achieved without sustained commitment from the businesses that mine, produce, manufacture, distribute, and sell goods around the world. Businesses create jobs and find workers to perform the jobs; they bear a responsibility to ensure that these working relationships respect national laws and fundamental labor rights. Some businesses and industry groups have long taken this responsibility seriously, through robust voluntary standards, due diligence, remediation, transparency, and engagement with stakeholders. Now, the combination of increased pressure from stakeholders and incentives to develop stronger responses is driving more businesses to acknowledge and address labor abuses in their supply chains. ILAB is committed to working alongside the business community in this effort.</p>
        <p>Since 1993, ILAB has developed a unique approach to using research to combat these abuses. ILAB employs a systematic and rigorous process to triangulate information, supporting the collection of in-country data, traveling to conduct first hand research in hard-to-reach places, and corroborating reports of labor abuses with credible local sources. This approach helps ensure the credibility and validity of ILAB&rsquo;s publications on child labor and forced labor. ILAB uses these reports to provide critical and actionable information to federal government agencies to safeguard federal procurement, help U.S. companies reduce labor abuses in their supply chains, and help foreign governments build their capacity to end modern slavery in their countries. This App is part of that effort.</p>
        <p>The App is also an important component of the U.S. government&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/265918.pdf" title="National Action Plan on Responsible Business Conduct (NAP-RBC)">National Action Plan on Responsible Business Conduct (NAP-RBC)</a>, which was developed pursuant to the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/corporate/mne/1922428.pdf" title="Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development&rsquo;s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development&rsquo;s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf" title="United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights">United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a>. The NAP-RBC encompasses the U.S. government&rsquo;s efforts and commitments to protect human rights in the overseas operations of U.S. businesses, through research, technical cooperation, federal procurement practices, labor diplomacy, and public-private dialogue. The NAP-RBC also emphasizes the positive contributions that businesses can make to respect human rights.</p>
        <p>In addition, since 1995, the U.S. Congress has also appropriated funding to ILAB for programming to combat child labor&nbsp;and related abuses internationally, through <a href="https://www.dol.gov/ilab/projects/" title="technical assistance projects">technical assistance projects</a>. ILAB has used these funds to implement more than 300 in over 95 countries, in partnership with a variety of governments, international institutions, civil society organizations and industry groups.</p>

    <h2 slot="label"><strong>¿Cómo desarrolló DOL esta aplicación?</strong></h2>
    <div slot="items">
        <p>Muchas organizaciones contribuyeron al desarrollo de esta aplicación, comenzando con la Academia Nacional de Ciencias y el Centro de Reflexión, Educación y Acción (CREA), que llevaron a cabo una investigación inicial bajo contrato con ILAB. ILAB también recopiló buenas prácticas de las muchas organizaciones cuyos materiales están vinculados a lo largo de la aplicación. Los socios interagenciales de todo el gobierno de los EE. UU. Proporcionaron comentarios sobre el borrador inicial, al igual que un grupo de expertos externos de empresas, instituciones académicas, sindicatos, la comunidad de inversión socialmente responsable y otros grupos de la sociedad civil. ILAB aprecia mucho las contribuciones de todos los que participaron en este proceso.</p>
        <p>La primera edición en línea de la aplicación se publicó en diciembre de 2012. En 2017, ILAB la adaptó para una aplicación móvil, lanzada en septiembre de 2017.</p>

    <h2 slot="label"><strong>Who is this App for?</strong></h2>
    <p slot="items">This App is for all companies.  Companies that have not yet put in place social compliance systems may find it most useful. It can also be useful for companies that have systems in place but are seeking improvement, or those who are working with partners in their global supply chains to establish such programs.</p>
</expandable-item>

    <h2 slot="label"><strong>How do I use this App?</strong></h2>
    <div slot="items">
        <p>The App is organized around <strong>eight steps to build or improve a social compliance system</strong>. Each step begins with learning objectives and key terms. Companies that are new to social compliance are encouraged to work through the modules in order. Companies that wish to improve elements of their systems or work with their supply chain partners on their systems can choose which modules best fit their needs. However, they are encouraged to consider implementing all elements of the social compliance system presented here in order to ensure integration of all components and effectiveness of their systems.</p>
        <p>As companies familiar with social compliance know, this App is just one of many guides, handbooks, white papers and other materials that provide information on social compliance. We hope this App provides useful guidance and examples available to help you build or strengthen your social compliance system or that of your global supply chain partners.</p>
        <p>As you use the App, you can provide feedback to assist us in improving its content. You are also encouraged to share your good practices related to social compliance from your own experience. You may do so by <a href="mailto:GlobalKids@dol.gov?subject=Comments on Comply Chain App" title="e-mailing ILAB">e-mailing ILAB</a>.</p>
        <p>Because ILAB&rsquo;s TVPRA mandate is to work with persons who are involved in the production of goods, this App focuses on social compliance programs for companies that produce goods, rather than services. In addition, as noted above, it focuses in particular on issues related to child labor and forced labor.</p>
