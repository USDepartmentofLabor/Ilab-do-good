<h1>Special Topic: Community-Based Child Labor Monitoring Systems</h1>
<p>In remote geographic locations and industries where production is largely dispersed and informal, some companies have pursued <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Action/Childlabourmonitoring/lang--en/index.htm" title="community-based child labor monitoring">community-based child labor monitoring</a> approaches as an alternative to formal auditing. This methodology has been tested in smallholder agricultural production in particular.</p>

    <p>In Cambodia, community volunteers are often the first line of defense in identifying children at risk of child labor. From 2012-2016, the U.S. Department of Labor funded a project implemented by <a href="https://www.worldvision.org/" title="World Vision">World Vision</a> and local partner organizations to combat child labor in Cambodia, particularly in the agriculture, fishing, and domestic service sectors. In an effort to strengthen community-based action to prevent and eliminate child labor, the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/ilab/projects/summaries/Cambodia_EXCEL.pdf" title="Cambodians EXCEL"><em>Cambodians EXCEL</em></a> project created local-level child labor monitoring systems (CLMS) in target communities. The CLMS is implemented by the existing child protection mechanism, Commune Councils on Women and Children, and is supplemented by village-level volunteer monitors who are trained by the project. These monitors track vulnerable children in the community, assess whether they are involved in or at risk of involvement in child labor, and take action to help children get the social services they need. Monitors also raise awareness about the benefits of education and track children&rsquo;s school attendance through meetings with teachers and home visits.</p>

<p>A CLMS is a time-intensive and resource-intensive approach to monitoring that requires extensive engagement at the community level. A key advantage is that it is a participatory approach that involves all appropriate stakeholders from the outset and ensures that all interactions with children&mdash;from identification to remediation&mdash;are carried out in a culturally appropriate manner.</p>
