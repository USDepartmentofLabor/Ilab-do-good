<p><strong>Communication About Remediation</strong></p>
<p>Particularly in cases where a complaint was received, leading to an audit and finding of violations, the submitter of the complaint&mdash;and possibly other stakeholders&mdash;will expect to know how the issue was handled. Your communication and public reporting should incorporate information about remediation to the extent possible. All such communication should ensure maximum protection for victims&rsquo; safety and privacy.</p>
