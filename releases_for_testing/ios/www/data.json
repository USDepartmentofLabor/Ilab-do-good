A code is a set of voluntary standards; in this respect it differs from law— although relevant laws(both U.S.and source country) must be taken into account, as should collective bargaining agreements and international framework agreements(IFAs) with union federations, which are enforceable contracts.A code is not a substitute for any of these instruments."
