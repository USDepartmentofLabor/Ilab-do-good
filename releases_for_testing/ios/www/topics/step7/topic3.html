<h1>Impact Evaluation </h1>
<p>Some companies and social compliance initiatives have begun to consider impact evaluation as a way to determine the long-term development impact of their efforts to reduce child labor, forced labor and other labor rights violations in their supply chains. Impact evaluation is a method that establishes, with statistical rigor, a causal linkage and quantifiable impact of a specific intervention. Impact evaluation isolates the effects of a program or service by comparing a treatment group (those exposed to the program or service) to an identical group that does not receive the program or service.</p>

    <h2><iron-icon icon="icons:lightbulb-outline"></iron-icon><strong>Example in Action: Better Work Impact Evaluation</strong></h2>
    <p>A multidisciplinary academic team from Tufts University and the ILO conducted a long-term impact evaluation of the Better Work program from 2009 to 2015. The methodology evaluated project outcomes beyond the factory or industry level. In certain countries, the study team used the methodology to look at both managers and workers to assess human development and economic development indicators. In other countries, impact measurement analyzed year-to-year changes in factory performance using a range of other qualitative research methods.</p>
    <p>The study presents evidence that improvements in working&nbsp;conditions lead to higher productivity and firm profitability. Key findings show that workers reach daily production targets nearly 40 minutes faster in factories with high rates of labor law compliance than in factories with lower rates. In addition, the study shows that when workers are concerned about verbal abuse, it takes them almost one extra hour per day to reach their production target.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that, while review and assessment methods like independent monitoring, independent verification and impact evaluation can verify that companies have robust systems in place to reduce the likelihood of child labor, forced labor and other labor abuses in supply chains, none of these methods guarantees that these abuses are not present.</p>
