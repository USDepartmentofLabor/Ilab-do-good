<h1>Using Risk and Impact Assessment Information </h1>
<p>Your social compliance team should have an information system to manage all of its data. All mapping and risk and impact assessment information should be entered systematically into this system and updated on a periodic basis.</p>
<p>Almost every risk and impact assessment exercise in any industry will uncover some risks of labor abuses, and possibly some adverse impacts you have already caused. You will then be faced with decisions about what to do to mitigate or remediate them.</p>
<p>If a risk and impact assessment reveals that a company is directly contributing to or causing adverse impacts or risks through its own sourcing or other practices, your first step should be to remediate these impacts and tackle these issues internally. As difficult as this process may be, you will not be able to manage external risks effectively if you cannot first manage internal ones.</p>
<p>If your company is exploring sourcing from a new area, your risk and impact assessment should reveal whether or not the risks are too great. If there are substantial risks, this merits strong consideration of whether your sourcing needs can be met elsewhere. If the risks are ones you are willing to take, your next step is to find suppliers that will participate in your social compliance program and work with you on continuous improvement. Those commitments should be codified in your contracts with suppliers; many companies require new suppliers to meet defined social compliance benchmarks before they can sell to the company.</p>
<p>If you are sourcing from an area with high levels of subcontracting, you may choose to limit how much production your suppliers can subcontract to outside entities. This limitation must then be included in contracts, and in turn monitored and enforced.</p>
<p>If your risk and impact assessment focuses on your established group of suppliers, your next steps will depend on those suppliers’ performance. If egregious labor abuses are taking place or are at risk of happening, you should attempt to work with the suppliers to remediate the abuses or improve their policies and processes. If a company does not have sufficient leverage with a supplier to change its behavior, you may attempt to increase your leverage by collaborating with other buyers or by offering capacity-building as an incentive. If the supplier does not respond to these efforts, you should consider terminating your sourcing relationship, while at the same time taking into account the impacts on the workers of ending the relationship and attempting to mitigate those impacts in the process.</p>
<p>In some cases, a risk and impact assessment will identify a specific underlying cause of labor abuses, and stakeholders may also suggest ideas for mitigation.</p>

    <p>For electronics companies, one of the key identified human rights and labor risks is conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where many of the minerals used to produce electronic products are sourced. The <a href="http://www.conflictfreesourcing.org/" title="Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative">Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative</a> (CFSI) was developed by the <a href="http://www.eiccoalition.org/" title="Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition">Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition</a> and the <a href="http://gesi.org/" title="Global e-Sustainability Initiative">Global e-Sustainability Initiative</a> in 2008 to promote responsible mineral sourcing from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. The CFSI has designed tools and resources that are used by more than 350 companies from a variety of sectors to monitor their supply chains. The CFSI developed the <a href="http://www.conflictfreesourcing.org/conflict-free-smelter-program/" title="Conflict-Free Smelter Program">Conflict-Free Smelter Program</a> that helps smelters and refiners validate, through independent third-party audits, their compliance with global standards, such as the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/corporate/mne/mining.htm" title="OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Area">OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas</a>.</p>

<p>In general, your responses to risk and impact assessment information should center around the impact on workers. In the early days of social compliance, companies that identified egregious labor abuses or serious risks in their supply chains tended to terminate sourcing immediately from the suppliers in question. Such actions sent a strong message to suppliers about compliance, but also had devastating consequences for workers. The issue of “responsible disengagement” from a supplier is explored in SOMO’s discussion paper, <a href="https://www.somo.nl/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/" title="Should I stay or should I go? Exploring the role of disengagement in human rights due diligence">Should I stay or should I go? Exploring the role of disengagement in human rights due diligence</a>. The growing consensus in social compliance is toward capacity-building and development of long-term relationships as a way to improve compliance, rather than immediate termination because of the negative effects on workers. The following example demonstrates this trend.</p>
<div class="example-in-action" id="mica">
    <h2><iron-icon icon="icons:lightbulb-outline"></iron-icon><strong>Example in Action</strong>: L’Oréal* and Responsible Mica Sourcing</h2>
    <p>Mica is a mineral used in various industries, including in the cosmetics industry, where it provides a glittering effect in a range of products. While L’Oréal sources more than 60 percent of its natural mica from the United States, the rest originates from other countries such as India, where there is a high risk of child labor and unsafe working conditions. Despite these risks, L’Oréal, which is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and a founding member of the <a href="http://www.responsible-mica-initiative.com/" title="Responsible Mica Initiative">Responsible Mica Initiative</a>, has made a commitment to remain in India and ensure the traceability and transparency of its supply chain. L’Oréal believes that discontinuing the use of Indian mica would not be beneficial to workers or their families, and could further exacerbate social and economic challenges. In India, L’Oréal implements a sustainable procurement program that works with a limited number of suppliers who commit to sourcing mica from legal, gated mines, where working conditions and human rights, including the prevention and elimination of child labor, can be monitored. L’Oréal’s suppliers in India undergo independent audits to monitor compliance and agree to invest in community-building activities to address the underlying causes of labor violations. By working with local NGOs and other stakeholders, L’Oréal aims to create a sustainable mica supply chain and improve the living and working conditions of the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Capacity-building and relationship-building usually entail some company investment in training and support for suppliers. However, many companies are adopting a model of upfront investment in building capacity of vendors, agents and suppliers, and then holding them responsible for social compliance performance—a model that can prove cost-effective over the long run. These and other training and communication issues are discussed in
    <app-link href="/step/4">Step 4, Communicate and Train Across Your Supply Chains</app-link>.</p>
<p>When you invest in a risk and impact assessment and uncover risks and mitigate them, do not forget to communicate about these efforts. Stakeholders who contributed to the risk and impact assessment deserve a “feedback loop” on how their information was used. If you took action on information that came from an existing complaint process or mechanism, you should report on your actions. Information on your risk and impact assessment and mitigation also belongs in the company’s public reports.</p>
<p>Finally, risk and impact assessment activities should be ongoing, and you should update mapping information regularly in your information system. Social compliance risks change over time as the environment evolves and a company’s operations change.</p>
